# IMU-for-high-jump
I've tracked a high jump using an Inertial Mesurament Unit for a project in school. I got some codes from [XioTechnologies](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Oscillatory-Motion-Tracking-With-x-IMU). There's some error because of it's double integration and my IMU can't get enough data for each second to correct a little bit it's error. A demostration for it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfUBOfba3PE).

I've used Arduino (ArduinoIMUCode) and Matlab (from XioTechnologies) to process the data.
